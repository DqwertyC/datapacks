# datapacks
A collection of my Minecraft datapacks.
Each folder is it's own separate pack and can be placed in the "datapacks" folder of your world save.

**crouch_to_place**  
This datapack will allow players to place blocks in midair while sneaking. If you want to limit the players that can use this ability, the main target selector is in scoreboard_check.mcfunction.
