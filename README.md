# datapacks
A collection of my Minecraft datapacks.
Each folder is it's own separate pack and can be placed in the "datapacks" folder of your world save.

**crouch_to_place**  
*min version: 1.15*
This datapack will allow players to place blocks in midair while sneaking. If you want to limit the players that can use this ability, the main target selector is in scoreboard_check.mcfunction.

**custom_enchanting**  
*min version: 20w11a*
This datapack provides a method to create custom enchantments. Includes example enchantment "enders_reach", which allows chestplates to be infused with eyes of ender to allow block placement in midair.
