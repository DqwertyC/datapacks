# datapacks
A collection of my Minecraft datapacks.
Each folder is it's own separate pack and can be placed in the "datapacks" folder of your world save.

**crouch_to_place**  
*min version: 1.15*  
This datapack will allow players to place blocks in midair while sneaking. If you want to limit the players that can use this ability, the main target selector is in scoreboard_check.mcfunction.

**custom_enchanting**  
*min version: 20w11a*  
This datapack provides a method to create custom enchantments. Throw an XP Bottle at an enchantment table, and it should activate. Place materials around the sides of the table and the item to enchant on top, then throw another XP Bottle at it.  
  
Designed to allow other creators to add their own data packs. Will upload a tutorial on how to create one soon.  

**enders_reach**
*min version: 20w11a*  
Uses the custom_enchanting datapack above to create armor that allows the wearer to place blocks in midair.
